# my-workflow
I kind of have OCD for code, design and things in general.


Editors
* For long time I preferred Notepad++. The best way to write code is to write every character of it
* Moved to Sublime Text on the mac ecosystem
* I use VSCode now. Because I liked the git integration and the search indexing
* My favorite editor theme is Material Theme, on both VSCode and Sublime
* Font I use on editors is Operator Mono. It's classy

Code
* I try to avoid using plugins for beautifying, auto-completions and linting. Have created a habit to type better code. But of course a human
* 2-Spaced
* I follow writing pseudo-code or pseudo-flow (bullet points) for every piece I code
* It helps understand the business logic, clarify doubts, and creates use-cases and edge-cases before even typing the code
* Having worked on multiple languages, I do forget and mixup syntaxes. You know where to find
* I've a bad habit of trying to perfect things and do extras. Sometimes it is really not required
* I prefer reusability and modularity on top of any pattern or architecture you use
* Naming conventions - bad ones irks

Tools
* Git - Gitub for public and Bitbucket for personal repos
* Mix of Trello (work and personal), Asana (work), Evernote (personal) for managing tasks
* Calendar - Heavily dependent on calendar and voice assistant for organizing and scheduling
* Photoshop - Yes I design. And sometimes I mockup/redesign if I don't like the designer's work to show my thoughts
* I liked Quip for small teams, but I no longer ran my agency and team when it was launced
* Chrome extensions - the great suspender. You will understand

Languages
* I've been friendly with any programming languages that came my way. They're mere syntaxes
* I've worked on PHP. ActionScript, Java, C/C++, JavaScript, bit of python etc
